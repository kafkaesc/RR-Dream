# Texas Rail

This project is about two types of routes. The kind you can use with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and the type that I dream of one day connecting the [major cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Triangle) of Texas by [rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail).

This site is a [React](https://reactjs.org) single-page app. It uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing. It utilizes [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for site styles. The app is tested using the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
